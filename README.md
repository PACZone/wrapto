Wrapto; Bridge your PAC coin to any other Chain

<br/>

# What is Wrapto?

The Wrapto Protocol is a bridge from [Pactus](https://pactus.org) PAC coins to every other well-known blockchain out there using a wPAC Token.

## Reason that we made that

In [PAC Zone](https://github.com/PACZone) (powered by [Dezh](https://dezh.tech)), we decided to design and implement this protocol over Pactus to unleash the power of PAC on DeFi, etc.

## Future Vision

Currently, Wrapto is a semi-centralized protocol (half decentralized) since there is no contract support on Pactus. [More details about this are here](#Documentation).
