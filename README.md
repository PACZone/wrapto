Wrapto; Bridge your PAC coin to any other Chain

# What is Wrapto?

The Wrapto Protocol is a bridge from [Pactus](https://pactus.org) PAC coins to every other well-known blockchain out there using a wPAC Token.

## Reason that we made that

In [PAC Zone](https://github.com/PACZone) (powered by [Dezh](https://dezh.tech)), we decided to design and implement this protocol over Pactus to unleash the power of PAC on DeFi, etc.

## Future Vision

Currently, Wrapto is a semi-centralized protocol (half decentralized) since there is no contract support on Pactus. [More details about this are here](#Documentation).

#### Our RoadMap

- [ ] We will add [wPAC](https://github.com/PACZone/wPAC) to More blockchains such as Solana, TON, Aptos, etc.
- [ ] We have a plan to update the protocol and use Pactus contracts (still decentralized and trustless but using contracts) in 2025 Q1 once contracts are available on Pactus (Wrapto Protocol V2).
- [ ] After contract support on the Pactus chain we will add wrapped other coins on Pactus too(Wrapto Protocol V2).

All V1(semi-centralized)an V2(decentralizes smart-contract) [Wrapped Tokens](https://github.com/PACZone/wPAC) minted on different networks, will be compatible with Wrapto.
